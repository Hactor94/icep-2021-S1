He explained that we front-end class need to connect login with API. So we were
still waiting for back end class team.

*We had a meeting with developers and changed some fields and add too. They were actually not
corresponding with database,back end class and front end class. W e chaned the register fields.

* We again had a scrum meeting and explained what developers meeting was all about to Matshidiso,Mohale and Mr.Moutlwatse.

*I went through Process Controll
-We have 3 approches that helps us to manage process control

1. Defined Process Control
-This is when each phase of the process is completed before the next phase starts.
-It works for construction where you need to first lay foundation before the walls.
-Any process that is the same and repitable can work well with defined proces control,
where there are few variables and nolt many uncertainities.

2.Statistical Process Control
-Uses statistical methods to monitor and control a process.
-This works well in a manufacturing context using measurements to manage how many pieces
or work done in an hour,day or week.
-To measure leak and cyle times.
-Many of the lean thinking akso use Statistical process control.

3.Emperical Process Control
-It is benefitial when they are many unknown and high levels of variability and uncertainity in both
process and product.
-It is build on the 3 foundational elements of transparency,inspection and adaptation.
-Uses cycle of plan,do,check and act.
-The backlog of work and to get the process done it needs to be transparent in order for planning to efective,
so you first plan enough to get something done.
- You build something.
- Then pause to look back on what you build that you can adjust your process.
-You might get some feedback so that you can adapt.
Scrum is irmly based in emperical process control
