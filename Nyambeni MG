 I am a pretty responsible person and I do what I am supposed to do. 
 As now, I am a student in school, therefore I do my homework every single day and study for what I have learned at home. 
 I also pay attention in class most of the time as well. Besides that, I organize my work as well. At home, I am a child, 
 so I respect my parents and help them to do house works, such as doing laundries and washing dishes. 
 I clean my room once a week as well because that is my responsibility as being a child. I also help out friends and classmates when they need help. 
 I give out advices and suggestions to them when they need support and help as well. 
 Generally, I can say that I am a responsible person who does my duties.
