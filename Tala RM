Our first day at work was on the 15th of June 2021, an induction was conducted and we learned about everything there 
is to know about ICEP. From Leak Teams, Amazon web service, programs offered at ICEP, and ofcourse ICEP tools. All the
Organization members were properly introduced and everyone got a chance to express themselves in terms of what they 
learned during the induction. 

A week after that we submitted a Work Integraded Learning Form so that we can be able to register IDC30BH and continue
with our work. After that we received an ivitation to a GITHUB Repository, where we will be collaborating and pushing
all our codes there. Some Tutorials were sent to us, further explaining what UML is and why it is important. Overview
of an Angular project was covered and some steps were covered on how to connect and manipulate database using Myphpadmin
and Node.js.
