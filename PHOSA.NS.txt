and starting to work remotely I register form agile foundation cource and complete my 1st module . 
 
We introduce to this system called Covid Compliace system .and we took an online meating with a our leading team just to familyrize the 
expectation of the system ,what kind of softwared needed.We were given role to play in the project ,they gave me a task of being a backend-developer for covid compalice
1st sprint task was to create and API for registrations and logging and test your data throuht postman which was entirely a new thing to me 
So i started going throught tutorial on you tube for node.js and angular,So my tools are VSCODE ,POSTMAN,GIT 
 

So we then being taughed that to make sure your work its safe and people can access your job please learn GIT to safe your Code .and then started to 
become something that we do on daily basic cause you need to push your data to git 

and from that it was learning timelesy ,you need to have a lot information which was a bit tough cause you get a clear picture whats going on but the 
fact that you want to learn and purse your dream career you hae to find ways even which its hard .
 

Our first pushcode project was actully running we called test our API from Postman but we greated a JSON file that has data so that we test with 
them we didnt embeded a database yet 
     
                                                                             AUGUST
